# Crash-PHP A basic way to understand, php. I just made a tutorial for my own warmUp,( im always open for any suggestion) and for those who seeking a get start idea about the language..  




Installing php:


go to https://www.php.net/downloads.php > check for current stable php and hit download ( the current version is 8.1.7 last update " 09 Jun 2022 ")
> place it under "C:\" > set up path variable in " Advanced System Settings" and add the php filePath where you put the "php files". you are pretty much Done !
> run "CMD" > put this on your console " php -S local:400 " cuz we have to create a localHost, that's what php does. To check it's installed or not .. 
and it will be showing you php server os "online"
ez.
